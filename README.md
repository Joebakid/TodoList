# 📋 TodoList App

This is a simple **Todo List application** built using **React**. It allows users to add, delete, and toggle tasks as completed. It also stores tasks in the browser's local storage, so your tasks persist even after you refresh the page or close the browser.

## 🚀 Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the task list using the input field and clicking "Add Task" or pressing the "Enter" key.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete individual tasks by clicking the delete button next to each task.
- **Toggle Completion**: Clicking on a task will toggle its completion status (cross out the text for completed tasks).
- **Reset Task List**: Users can reset the entire task list with a single click of the "Reset TaskList" button.
- **Local Storage**: The app stores the task list in the browser’s local storage, meaning tasks will persist even if the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and can be used on mobile devices as well as desktop.
